TODO

- the WordType should be an unsigned u64

- dedicated EU for ALU, LOAD/STORE etc

- integration test that loads data

- integration test that stores data

- there is no back pressure if there are no physical registers, just panic

- optimize the flush of the ROB (idle entries can be skipped)

- implement store buffer flush

- restore the 'control' instr

- add DSB

- unit tests!

- support for precise exceptions

- syntax: case insensitive keywords

- syntax: single line comments

- syntax: multiline comment

- syntax: new lines

- syntax: unwanted semicolon after instructions

- store to load forwarding: currently the store in the sb isn't seen

- implement print of memory

- CPU metrics frequency:
    - currently it is tied to the CPU frequency; but at higher frequency, the output will go too fast.

DONE

- EU doesn't need Instr to be passed to cycle method

- EU should have access to memory subsystem on construction

- pull out the execute method for EU

- the WordType should be called DWordType

- integration tests!

- option to trace pipeline flushes

- case insensitive registers

- recording number of instruction that will not retire due to bad speculation

TODO

- recording number of instruction that will not retire due to bad speculation

- implement store buffer flush

- restore the 'control' instr

- add DSB

- unit tests!

- integration tests!

- support for precise exceptions

- syntax: case insensitive keywords/registers

- syntax: single line comments

- syntax: multiline comment

- syntax: new lines

- syntax: unwanted semicolon after instructions

- instruction print should use labels

- instructions should keep their labels

- store to load forwarding: currently the store in the sb isn't seen

- implement print of memory

- CPU metrics frequency:
    - currently it is tied to the CPU frequency; but at higher frequency, the output will go too fast.

DONE

BUGS

- there is no back pressure if there are no physical registers, just panic
    - each instruction should track how many physical registers it needs
    and don't allow for an instruction to get a rs if there are not sufficient
    physical registers.

- restore the 'control' instr

- store to load forwarding: currently the store in the sb isn't seen so CPU becomes incoherent

TODO

- the EU should write directly to the physical register

- integration test: stack push

- integration test: stack pop

- Backend.cycle_eu_table should move to EUTable.

- option to disable speculative execution

- dedicated EU for ALU, LOAD/STORE etc

- optimize the flush of the ROB (idle entries can be skipped)

- support for precise exceptions

- syntax: case insensitive keywords

- syntax: single line comments

- syntax: multiline comment

- syntax: new lines

- syntax: unwanted semicolon after instructions

- CPU metrics frequency:
    - currently it is tied to the CPU frequency; but at higher frequency, the output will go too fast.

DONE

- implement store buffer flush

- store should only be done with memindirectregister

- load should only be done with memindirectregister/memory(direct.. goodname)

- STR broken: allocation of the store doesn't work.

- perf counters need to be shared with EU

- decouple the RS operands from the Instruction operands.

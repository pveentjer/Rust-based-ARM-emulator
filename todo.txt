BUGS

- restore the 'control' instr

- fix parsing of instructions that modify the control flow implicitly (so when accessing e.g. IP)

TODO

- the AST operands should get their own visit methods

- cdb_broadcast_buffer filling should be done in execute

- program/loader should not construct 'Instr'; they are CPU internal detail for decoded instructions

- add ConditionCode operand

- add CSINC

- add CSEL

- add CSET

- clean up the pc_update in the B.. methods

- integration test: stack push

- integration test: stack pop

- Backend.cycle_eu_table should move to EUTable.

- option to disable speculative execution

- dedicated EU for ALU, LOAD/STORE etc

- optimize the flush of the ROB (idle entries can be skipped)

- syntax: case insensitive keywords

- syntax: new lines

BUGS

- fix BNE

- there is no back pressure if there are no physical registers, just panic
    - each instruction should track how many physical registers it needs to allocate
    and don't allow for an instruction to get a rs if there are not sufficient
    physical registers.

- restore the 'control' instr

- store to load forwarding: currently the store in the sb isn't seen so CPU becomes incoherent

TODO

- operands can move to the AST section since not used inside the CPU

- CDBBroadcast: missing load/store

- CDBbroadcast: missing branch

- DataProcessing: operand 2

- DataProcessingInstr: register renaming

- LoadStore instruction: register renaming

- program/loader should not construct 'Instr'; they are CPU internal detail for decoded instructions

- LoadStoreInstr implement Display

- DataProcessingInstr implement Display

- BranchInstr implement Display

- add ConditionCode operand

- add TST

- add TEQ

- add MVN

- add CSINC

- add CSEL

- add CSET

- clean up the pc_update in the B.. methods

- add test CMP/BEQ

- add test CMP/BLE

- integration test: stack push

- integration test: stack pop

- Backend.cycle_eu_table should move to EUTable.

- option to disable speculative execution

- dedicated EU for ALU, LOAD/STORE etc

- optimize the flush of the ROB (idle entries can be skipped)

- support for precise exceptions

- syntax: case insensitive keywords

- syntax: single line comments

- syntax: multiline comment

- syntax: new lines

- syntax: unwanted semicolon after instructions

DONE

- DataProcessing: Operand2 doesn't need to be available at all.

- RSInstr:DataProcessing deal properly with the operand2

- CDBbroadcast not implemented

- follow the ARM instruction layout

- figure out how the reservation station needs to deal with the different instruction classes

- fix frontend with the new instruction hierarchy

- pull out fields for RSInstr enum

- pull out fields for Instr enum

- NOP: how does it fit into the new instruction hierarchy

- PRINTR: how does it fit into the new instruction hierarchy

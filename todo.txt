TODO

- restore the 'control' instr

- fix crash with

- fix crash with rob >2
    - it immediately starts to fail after a branch misprediction

- add DSB

- can the B instruction be optimized since the branch is always taken. Currently it will stop placing
 instructions in the instruction queue until B has retired and this leads to a stall.

- unit tests!

- integration tests!

- support for precise exceptions

- syntax: case insensitive keywords/registers

- syntax: single line comments

- syntax: multiline comment

- syntax: new lines

- syntax: unwanted semicolon after instructions

- instruction print should use labels

- instructions should keep their labels

- store to load forwarding: currently the store in the sb isn't seen

- implement print of memory

- CPU metrics frequency:
    - currently it is tied to the CPU frequency; but at higher frequency, the output will go too fast.

DONE

- static branch predictor

- fix the branch instructions to use the pc from the instr.

- add branch monitoring

- add branch prediction accuracy monitoring
